Ok so my objective was to make three "slides" which would scroll "smoothly" when scrolling through them.
For this I first tought of using only 3 divs with 3 images, so i could send one div up and center another
that however did not work well, I was having trouble using JS and didn't know of CSS scrolling capabilities

I started searching and discovered about CSS snapping elements, and how it's features works
i learned that there are already lots of elements for snapping elements the way you want
so i started searching what i should do to have the effects i wanted
first was taking of margins and paddings and hidding the scrollbar by setting it's width to none
i also set scroll behavior to smooth to all elements, but if i wanted to do it separately, i saw it's advised to set html element
to smooth, because it seems to affect the effects.
after that it was time to setup the container, setting it to fit the viewport, i also had to set it's overflow y to scroll so it does the
snapping correctly and set the snap properly with snap type y mandatory
then it was time for setting the snap type of the slides properly said to the center
and make the images fit right in the screen 
a thing about images is that they're inline elements, so they leave space below them, for this to not happen you have to set them to display
block

and that was about it
it ended up being really simple, but took me about 2 hours to find the correct way to do what I wanted to
